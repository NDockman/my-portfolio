# my-portfolio

My portfolio is broken up into a CSS stylesheet and a HTML file. The objective of my portfolio is to appeal to potential employers by showcasing my skill as a programmer. By having a main section with the applications I have completed and deployed, employers can easily find my greatest coding achievements.
